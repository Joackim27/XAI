# Methodology

## 1. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values:** No missing values found.  
- **Data Types:** All columns are numerical except the target column.  
- **Conclusion:** No data cleaning required.  

## 2. Data Exploration and Feature Selection
- Transformed the target column:  
  - Dropout â†’ `0`  
  - Enrolled â†’ `1`  
  - Graduate â†’ `2`  
- Used a **Seaborn heatmap** to analyze feature correlations and reduce redundancy among curriculum-related features.  
- Finalized feature selection before proceeding with modeling.  

## 3. Model Selection and Training
- Implemented **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, selecting the model with higher accuracy.  
- If both models have equal accuracy, either one is chosen.  

## 4. Model Interpretation
- Utilized **SHAP** for both local and global interpretability.  
- Used **LIME** for additional local interpretability.
